# web-calculator
A simple, web-based calculator using JS, HTML, and CSS. 

This Project was designed for me to get better skills in JS so I can tackle harder challenges when I start developing apps for the congressional app challenge and a personal music app. 

The calculator functionality is very self explanatory as it was modeled off a generic calculator like the one on an iphone.
